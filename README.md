SHARC assembly Sublime Syntax
=============================

IMPORTANT MESSAGE: THIS REPOSITORY WILL NO LONGER BE MAINTAINED.

I have zero interest and little remaining knowledge in DSP chips anymore. If you wish to see a change, you'll have to fork the repo. Sorry. The good news is that it's not that hard to add things.

A syntax definition for the SHARC's (The DSP board from Analog Devices) assembly language. I think it works reasonably well. As far as I know, no other ones exist. It does *not* include keywords for Analog Devices' TigerSHARC board, and the Blackfin definitions are not very well researched. I spent the semester with a SHARC board, so there you go.

I made this because I really don't like the VisualDSP++ IDE that much. No word wrap, tabs, etc...

Installation (Windows):
- Get sublime_text.
- Install "Package Control" : https://sublime.wbond.net/installation#st2
- Extract/copy/Whatever-I-Don't-Care "Assembly x86 AT&T.tmLanguage" and "Comments (ASM x86).tmPreferences" into [sublime directory]\Data\Packages\User\
- Or simply `git clone' this repo.
- I'm currently attempting to move this to Package control, so sit tight.

Pull requests and bug reports always welcome.

Sublime should automatically take care of the syntax highlighting, so there's no need to restart.
